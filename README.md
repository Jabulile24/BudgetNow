# Budget Tracker App

## 📱 About the App
The Budget Tracker is an Android app built using Kotlin to help users manage their spending. It allows users to:
- Log expenses by category
- Set minimum and maximum budget goals
- View graphs of spending over time
- Earn badges for good budget habits

This app was built for my final POE submission and runs on a physical Android device.
